### Project Goal
Develop a market segmentation system and supporting materials

### Data 
Simmons National Consumer Study (NCS): American family lifestyles, media, and product preferences 

### Summary
Created market segmentation for an environmentally conscious company that produces food products and is looking to expand brand awareness and adoption for its healthy packaged foods. The variables used in the marketing segmentation system are environmentally conscious, early adopters, volunteer time, read labels, gender, household purchasing power, and watch morning shows (NBC, ABC, CBS). According to the data, consumers whose values most align with an environmentally and socially conscious company that produces healthy food are in cluster 4. From the segmentation system, a marketing strategy could be to create advertising geared toward females during ABC and CBS morning shows to sell food products. These ads should highlight the social, environmental, and health benefits of brand and food choices.

### Results
Cluster 4: Environmentally conscious & socially aware
highest environmentally conscious, above average early adopter, highest volunteer time, highest reads labels, lowest number of males, highest number of females, second highest purchasing power (-1.3% below highest), highest watches ABC and CBS morning shows

### Included
Project written report, python code, and code output

### Programs
Python (rpy2 package to run R NbClust package during cluster analysis, numpy, pandas)
